# Hello World program in PYTHON
print("Hello World!")

"""
 Python code in INTERPRETED

 unlike COMPILER (which translates whole program in machine language at once),
 interpreter translates the just one statement at a time (in machine language).

 overall time taken by compiler to translate program in machine language is less
 as compared to interpreter
 COMPILER is faster than INTERPRETER

 interpreter does not generate an intermediary code and hence requires less memory
 compiler always generates an intermediary object code hence more memory is needed

# A sequence of operands and operators is called is called an EXPRESSION
print("Python" * 10)

# Python will be printed 10 times, in python first expression is evaluated then print statement executes
